  <b>  Hello! <br>
    <br>
I'm Kumari Shalini from Ranchi (Jharkhand), and I'm 21 years old. I have done my schooling from St. Francis Convent School, Agra (UP) with 81.75%. And I passed my 12th from Hillman Public School, Agra (UP) with 74%. And now I am pursuing my B.Tech degree (branch Information Technology) from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai and my current UG percentage is 85.49% (till 6th semester). I have been to many places and I get adapted to the place and their culture very easily. <br><br>

 My strength are quick learning and hard-working with a positive attitude and my biggest strength is my flexibility which makes me handle any kind of situation, but my weakness is sometimes I get nervous in some situations. My hobbies are listening to music and watching movies but besides it I love travelling and cooking. I love to meet new people and make new friends, improve my knowledge and enjoying the art of travelling. And also I like reading a self-help book but this interest depends on my mood. <br><br>


Actually, I want to do everything in my life whatever I have not done. Nothing comes in your hands without hard-working. So, believe in hard work, and never ever lose hope in your life. So, my goal is to achieve the highest level of proficiency and my social goal is to be a successful and respected person in my society. <br><br>

Thank You</b> <br>
